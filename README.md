# Lido Withdrawals Automation by Stakely.io

Lido Withdrawals Automation is a command-line tool that assists with the LIDO validators withdrawal process. The tool streamlines the procedure by fetching validators data, generating withdrawal messages, signing them with a remote signer, encrypting the signed messages, and saving them to the output folder.

## Features

- Fetches validator data from the Kapi endpoint
- Creates withdrawal messages and signs them using the remote signer
- Encrypts the signed messages using the specified password
- Saves the encrypted messages to a specified output folder

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= v18.x
- Access to a local kAPI endpoint
- Access to a web3 remote signer endpoint
- Access to a beacon node endpoint

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stakely/lido-withdrawals-automation.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd lido-withdrawals-automation
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root folder and set the following environment variables:

```
PERCENTAGE=<percentage_of_validators_to_withdraw>
KAPI_URL=<kapi_endpoint_url>
REMOTE_SIGNER_URL=<remote_signer_url>
PASSWORD=<password_to_encrypt_signed_messages>
OUTPUT_FOLDER=<path_to_output_folder>
OPERATOR_ID=<operator_id>
BEACON_NODE_URL=<beacon_node_url>
MODULE_ID=<module_id>
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual values. For example:

```
PERCENTAGE=10
KAPI_URL=https://example.com/kapi
REMOTE_SIGNER_URL=https://remotesigner.local:8080
PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
OUTPUT_FOLDER=/path/to/your/output-folder
OPERATOR_ID=123
BEACON_NODE_URL=http://localhost:5052
MODULE_ID=1
```

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The script will check the environment variables and prompt you for any missing values. After providing the required information, the script will fetch validator data, create withdrawal messages, sign them, encrypt the signed messages, and save them to the output folder.
